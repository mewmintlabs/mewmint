Mewmint Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Mewmint Core is a cryptocurrency client based on Bitcoin Core. It builds upon the proven technology of Bitcoin while introducing its own unique features and improvements. Like Bitcoin, it downloads and stores the entire history of transactions, which requires significant disk space. The synchronization process can take several hours to a day, depending on your computer and network connection.
